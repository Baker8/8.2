GAME MECHANICS

Player 1 (RED)  uses wsad
Player 2 (BLUE) uses ikjl

Hold down jump button for longer to jump higher

Crouch to fall through notes

NOTES
Jump on notes to change them to your color and gain score.

Short notes are worth more points than long notes.

You can step up onto notes that are a major second above the note you are currently on (a whole step). If you fall past a really wide note, you may find yourself on top of it. 
 

PASSIVE
The closer you are to the ground, the more passive score you gain per second.

If you touch the ground, you lose a lump sum of score, and gain no passive as long as you are on the ground.

If you are on the ground, you jump really, really high. Use this to get back in the game.

GAME
Game speeds up over time. You will ALWAYS be able to move forward at the same speed, but stop for even a second and you will be thrown back

If it seems like stuff is de-synced at the beginning of a game, you are totally right, it is. It gets sorted after a second or two though.
